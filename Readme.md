# Kubernetes CI/CD Pipeline

An open source Jenkins pipeline tool purpose built for Kubernetes containers.

Jenkins uses a custom workflow to build and deploy applications. The whole CI/CD pipeline is built using just three manifest files, which have very distinctive roles in the build process.

-   **build.bitesize** - defines how to build one or more components
-   **application.bitesize** - defines how to build one or more
    applications using required components and
    external dependencies
-   **environments.bitesize** - defines how to layout environments,
    which applications (services) to run in them, what tests to run
    against your applications and the method to deploy applications.
    Builds out the whole CI/CD pipeline

First, let’s define some terms to understand what exactly they mean in our context:

| Term | Definition |
| --- | :--- |
| *Component* | Individual code repository necessary to create an Application. Your application will have one or more internal components. |
| *Application*      | Artifacts as a single Artifact necessary to create a running instance (a collection of components). Application includes the full stack required to run an instance. |
| *Build* | Process that outputs artifacts (Debian Package, Docker Image, etc…) |
| *Job* | An instance (success or fail) of a Build |
| *Build Definition* | What actions need to be executed to generate the output artifact. |
| *Job Definition* | Specifics related to the Job, generally Version Number, Tags, .... |
| *Build Dependency* | A tool or utility necessary to create a Component Artifact. |
| *Service* | Instance (or multiple grouped instances in HA mode) of a running application. |
| *Environment* | Collection of services, grouped together to represent a fully working application stack. |
